# Original Data and Metadata

This folder is where you place a copy of every original data file from which you extract any of the data used in your study. These data files should be placed directly into the `original-data` directory.

Occasionally, an original data file is in a format that cannot be read by the statistical software you are using for your project (for example, a PDF file that needs to be read using optical character recognition). In this case, you need to create a modified version of the original data file that is in a format your software can read. 

When you need to create an importable version of an original data file, you should keep both versions (importable and original) in the Data folder.  (The original and importable versions of a data file should be given different names.)

This folder also contains the sub-folder `metadata`, the contents of which is described in the `README` file within that folder.
