# Original Data

We use the term "original data file" to refer to a file from which you 
took any of the statistical data you used for your project.

Your `original-data` folder should contain a copies of all your 
original data files.

Any data that were necessary for any part of the processing and/or 
analysis you reported in your paper should be contained in one of the 
original data files in your `original-data` folder.

Every original data file should be saved in exactly the format it was 
in when you first obtained it.You may choose to change the name of an 
original data file when you save it in your `original-data` folder, but 
other than that the file should not be modified in any way.
